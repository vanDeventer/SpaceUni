## 3.0 Preamble
### Participants
UT3 (lead), All
### Description
This Action Line has the following main objectives:
- **Building future collaborative actions** by analytical
comparison of existing courses at partner universities and feedback from stakeholders on future needs for student competences.
- **Implementing joint common courses** to share cross- sectoral expertise
- **Implementing joint common programmes** to provide new interdisciplinary curricula

Our aim is to bring together the combined expertise of our partners not only to provide a unique and world-class European teaching environment in space sciences but also to propose in addition interdisciplinary and cross-sector curricula combining with humanities. In many domains it is essential that students in humanities have a clear overview of space sciences, technology and engineering. To give only a few examples; to accurately communicate on the most recent space related science and engineering in news articles (scientific journalism); to advance the field of space medicine; to develop European and International Law concerning satellites and space exploration; to prepare for living on the Moon and Mars with everything that it implies for infrastructure, energy supply and sustainable resources; to produce realistic science fiction and movies, computer games, educative materials (books, cartoons) for children. Conversely it would be highly beneficial that graduates in space science and engineering have competencies for example in communication, knowledge diffusion, business, management, entrepreneurship, languages, ethics, history-of-science and so on. Courses will be proposed for example with two related majors or with one major and one minor and involve European mobility and collaborative learning. For example, groups of students in different locations will work together for practical work and on projects One major competition will be organised each year grouping together students from the different universities to compete as a team working on the conception of a space based project. Multicultural teams will be organized to solve practical space problems and develop ability to work remotely. There will be supervised student-to-student teaching (e.g. a specialised Masters student teaches introduction to space science to students in humanities) that would have high pedagogical value both for teachers and trainees. It is also proposed to provide continuing education programs, summer programs and awareness courses for staff in other disciplines to ensure everybody can have access to the space sector independent of gender, education, age, expertise, and so on. Student professional networks will be developed to build a space-oriented community. Innovative teaching methods will be included in these curricula, either in presence or distance learning, as described in WP4, to make them student centred and focussed on essential competences for future professional requirements.

## 3.1 Mapping and sharing of partner competences
### Participants
UT3 (Lead), All
### Description
After an initial analysis (that will be extended and refined during the first stages of the project) four major application segments for space-based activities have been identified.

|I. Our Earth|II. Sustainable Space|III. Space exploration & discovery|IV. Space settlement & exploration|
|---|---|---|---|
|Earth Science|Space debris, On Orbit servicing|Space Mission planning|Architecture & construction|
|Climate change|Science & technology|Space energy systems architecture|Agriculture (breeding)|
| Tele-detection &  Earth observation. Monitoring (ice, forest, ...) |Space environment|Our origins (Cosmology, star formation, exobiology, philosophy, ...)|Sociology of sciences, sociological studies on human behavior and interactions|
|Natural resources|Launchers & rockets|Planetology|Space environment psychology|
|Geo data|EO & telecom satellites|Space probes|Medecine, health, telemedicine, psychology|
|(Urban) mobility|Law|AI & Robotics|Space turism|
|Telecommunication & navigation| | |ISRU, resources|
Precision agriculture| | |Space navigation (space ports, operation, ...)|

It is planned to link these application domains to the identified relevant academic fields so as to fill in the twenty four cells of the resulting matrix with information on challenges, needs, available courses, competencies, innovation features and approaches, connections with the world of work, technological potential for growth. A first matrix will give a reliable and in-depth picture of the present situation within the alliance and identify precisely courses that could be best shared. It will also specify what languages the different courses are currently given in.

|Academic field|As I.|As II.|As III.|As IV.|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Science and engineering|Arctic as a climate change monitor for Earth|Spacecraft environment interactions|Robotics|Advanced engineering design|
|Economy, business, finance|Micro & macro economy|Technological entrepreneurship| | |
|Medecine & health| | | | |
|Social & human science| |Management of international consortia|Imagination and representation of space|Psychology: stress in confined spaces|
|Art & cultural studies|Northern lights & belief amongst indigenous population| |Lexicology/literature around space|Science fiction movies|
|Innovation & patents, entrepreneurship 

Note the table is only partially completed for illustration of the idea, giving some (single) examples of existing courses. The work to fully fill it in is planned during the first year of the project.

*Year 1. Mapping of partner competences*

## 3.2 Today and tomorrow's needs for student competences
### Participants
UT3 (lead), All
### Description
The Alliance is uniquely capable of taking into account its wide range of expertise and already acquired extensive contacts with the space industry and European Space Institutes to rapidly adapt to propose the most relevant courses to present European needs in the Space Domain. This will build on and enlarge existing collaboration such as the SpaceMaster (spacemaster.eu) in which Toulouse and LTU already work together. Our primary goal is to work towards tomorrow’s needs and the future positioning of Europe as a major actor in space related activities. In order to do this, we will prepare send and then analyse a questionnaire to identified stakeholders and interested parties concentrating particularly on future employers of our students in a European context. This will include not only our close industrial and institutional partners in the space domain but also other pertinent sectors such as journalism, medicine and so on. The questionnaire will ask what they consider to be the principal competences needed by the students they employ and how they consider this may evolve in the years to come. It will be based on principles such as technology driven advances, long-term goals, life-long learning, societal challenges, and jobs, industry and life in the future.

*Year 1. Identify key stakeholders (target at least 5 per partner), Create the common questionnaire with all partners - online, Contact Stakeholders and assure their participation, Synthesis and analysis of results, Follow-up, Written report of results.*

## 3.3 Completing the catalogue of courses
### Participants
UT3 (lead), All
### Description
Following the previous analysis, we will work towards providing a complete catalogue of UNIVERSEH courses in all disciplines and segments. A second matrix to be drawn up with a **two-year goal** will identify the cells to be filled or reinforced i.e where courses need to be reinforced or created in order to cover correctly the entire spectra of fields and applications. This second matrix will give a long-term vision and provide a firm basis for a shared, integrated long-term joint strategy. Our vision is to provide at least one course (2 ECTS minimum) for each cell of the matrix, within the framework of our collaboration (including existing and new courses). The **7-year vision** is then to group cells in order to create integrated courses in two or more disciplines and to evolve towards the possibility of students being able to customise their choice of where and what to study.

*Year 2. Design 10 new 2-3 ECTS courses. We will design curricula according to a competency-based approach with a tight link with WP4 for the way students are to be taught.*

## 3.4 Toward a common Universeh Diploma
### Participants
UT3 (lead), All
### Description
The Erasmus program and ECTS system provide a framework for recognition of studies carried out during mobility by equivalence at another European University. However, there is still much work to be done to harmonise and make more flexible national and local regulations in order to work towards awarding of a joint (especially multiple-partner) degree on a collaborative European scale with a program tailored to each student's individual needs. We will work towards this goal within our program tailored on space and humanities. In the short term this can involve the awarding of one or more national degrees together with a Universeh diploma. In the long run this would be a preparation for awarding a European degree if regulations evolve to allow this. One-first step could be a “European label” for a Master Thesis as the one that already exists for the doctorate and the use of the Europass model for a diploma supplement. There is also the question of developing a common marking system, for example, through the Egracons European grading conversion system;

**3-year target**. Common diploma supplement for all students taking part in Universeh Activities;

**7-year vision**. A common Universeh diploma or joint diploma according to regulatory possibilities

## 3.5 Short programs and space awareness
### Participants
UT3 (lead), All
### Description
We will increase space awareness for all students within the Alliance by proposing short programmes focussing on this area. The three-year target is to define the most important subject areas and target audiences. During this time, initiatives will also be made to increase the number of non-expert courses included in options available presently to students within their course structure and propose popular science lectures for all students for example during the lunchtime break (sandwich lectures for example). Certain of these lectures will involve invited staff on mobility within the Alliance. The long-term aim is to work on a common series of lectures, courses and on-line material available for increasing familiarity with space related science and engineering that could be proposed at all levels from bachelors to doctorate to promote a major/minor discipline system and interdisciplinary degrees. In particular, for doctoral students we plan to provide courses on Research Integrity and Research Ethics so that they will acquire an understanding of these questions for their future professional activities. Through dialogue with researchers and case studies, they will explore questions surrounding their practices, workplace and responsibilities in a research context with examples in spatial research. Furthermore, online courses on European Culture will be created for incoming Erasmus students and on the history of space science and exploration for students who are to be delivered the European University Supplement.

*Year 2. Identification of available resources in terms of lecturers (interest, availability and expertise) and teaching equipment.*

**3-year target**. Implement 10 new courses of 2-3 ECTS. Matrix completed over the whole Alliance. Seminar on interdisciplinary strategies proposed for teachers and students.

**7-year vision**. Matrix of courses available at each university to all students interested. We will design piloting tools to continuously assess and adjust curricula (feedback from students and stakeholders) with the goal to provide a proof of concept in the design of new multi-countries competency-based programs taking into account the curriculum development frameworks, teaching and learning theories, and innovative digital learning platforms.

## 3.6 Semester exchange
### Participants
UT3 (lead), All
### Description
Students from each participating partner will be encouraged to take part in a specific semester exchange involving mobility to one or more of the other partners. Recognition of the semester will be built on the Erasmus program but will go further by allowing the possibility of several short exchanges, online pooled-learning and a coordinated program involving all the partners in the development of syllabi. The level of this semester is optimally last year bachelors/first year masters so it can be included in both and be a passage between general studies and specialisation. Local language courses will be provided during these semesters.

**3-year target**. Drive enhanced mobility amongst the partners involving existing courses and possibilities for internships including with collaborating industrial partners. Start to produce the courses for a common semester.

**7-year vision.** This semester will consist of a series of precisely programmed activities to give the essential broad knowledge determined from task 3.2 and will be proposed throughout the Alliance.

## 3.7 Joint Bachelor programs
We will work towards Joint Bachelor programs in Space and humanities. Our first aim is to work towards space-awareness minors for students of other disciplines. This could build for example on existing course structures such as the Science and Humanities bachelor presently being set up in Toulouse for which we plan to propose at least one course within the first 3-years. Another aim is to use the competences and course available within the Alliance to tailor undergraduate courses more specifically to pursuing a future masters programs in space science. The long-term aim is to make possible fully personalised academic programs by establishing common agreements (number of ECTS to validate a specialisation) and implementing skill-based curricula with a ‘mix and match’ approach. Proposing common courses on he bachelor level is, however, a major challenge, since these classes are traditionally taught in the native language. Language issues will be considered in WP2. In particular, the final exam presents a significant hurdle for many students, as they are afraid to obtain bad marks due to the language barrier. We will therefore enable students to follow the classes in English or in the host language and take the exams in their native language. We also plan to develop and promote practical and work-based experience classes, involving not only students, academics and researchers, but also businesses, regional actors and civil society actors. Mobility, will provide good opportunities to discover the language and the culture of the other countries

**3-year target**. Offer the possibility of space-based options working towards a space minor in other disciplines. Identify new possible joint programmes.

**7-year vision** Create and implement new joint bachelor programmes. Work towards flexible curricula with cross-disciplinary /multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches.

**Example study plan**
- Semester 1: Mathematics; History; Documentation, Modern languages; Social psychology: human behaviour in small groups
- Semester 2: Biology; Physics and chemistry; Philosophy; Intercultural management; Computer science; Modern languages
- Semester 3: Mathematics; Modern languages; History of Science; Science and Technology Studies; Documentation
- Semester 4: Biology, Physics and Chemistry, Geography, Management of international consortia; Modern Languages, Computer Studies
- Semester 5: Semester exchange program (as task 3.6) including for example History of Space Exploration; Space science; Space engineering; Space mechanics; Human-machine interaction; Finance and innovation; Geology; Space observations of the Earth; Design on system level, Information technologies and artificial intelligence
- Semester 6: Philosophy and ethics in science; Oral and written expression; Options in Communication or Education

The above study plan, tailored to working in the fields of teaching or scientific communication (documentation, journalism, mediation, museums, research) either immediately or following the appropriate Masters, is given as one example only; The final choice of programs will be tailored to the needs of stakeholders as determined by task 3.2 and other tracks more specifically related to the space industry will be proposed

## 3.8 Joint Master programs
### Participants
UT3 (Lead), All
### Description
The Masters level of studies is the prime stage of specialisation for forming the European professionals of tomorrow in space-related activities. More and more courses are being proposed at Masters level in English and a number of highly relevant courses exist already among the partners. This facilitates the possibility for academic mobility through the existing Erasmus procedure and local agreements. Our **seven-year vision** that **will be initiated during the first three years** is to drive the process of transferring a small number of targeted Masters into English and putting in place other measures to facilitate exchange of students. The recognition and lack of coherence in the structure of different Masters programs (spacemaster excepted) strongly limits present mobility at Masters level. Also the present possibility for combining mobility and interdisciplinary studies is almost non-existent. Our long-term vision is to get over these difficulties though a Joint Master program with different specialisations and paths (e.g. Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Green space, Sustainable development, Space Medicine) synergising resources and combining infrastructure of the partner universities. Depending on personal interests, students will be able to "mix and match" between modules from the partner universities, tailored to their own career and involving both mobility and the use of modern technology for distance learning. The universities involved in this project have strong research activities, and interaction of the students with researchers will be significant. There will also be extensive interaction with professionals and companies in the space sector and training in transferable skills (e.g. leadership skills, project management). We indicate a proposed basic structure below.

**3-year target**. Identify targeted Masters and motivate them to include an English Language Track if not done already. Put in place measures to facilitate exchange of students and encourage mobility. Identify new possible joint programmes.

**7-year vision**. Create and implement new joint masters programmes. Work towards flexible curricula with cross- disciplinary /multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches.

**Example study plan**
- Semester 1: Semester exchange program (as task 3.6)
- Semester 2 and Semester 3 according to specialisation with the possibility to choose two different sectors for each semester
- Semester 4 Master thesis work at one of the 6 universities in the Alliance, stake-holder or other.

## 3.9 Joint Doctoral programs and joint Doctorates
### Participants
UT3 (lead), All
### Description
Because our universities are places of teaching and creation of new knowledge, research which is an integral part of our professions, will have a significant place in this project. Master's internships at a partner university will be an opportunity to identify students motivated by a doctorate and to choose those who will have the skills.

As a long term aim we will take as a basis the courses prepared in 3.5 to design and implement a common joint doctoral program available to students at each of the partners. Doctoral students will also be encouraged to attend the organised Summer and Winter Schools (WP2) with the long term goal of a workshop adapted to their level. Mobility of students within the Alliance will be encouraged and funding found for this. Doctoral students will be encouraged to carry out teaching activities within the Alliance and access to stakeholders and industrial partners will be facilitated.

Each partner will seek to provide funding to set up a joint supervised doctorate for at least one interdisciplinary doctorate with one other partner. This is a particularly interesting action since interdisciplinary subjects are difficult to fund through traditional mechanisms. The theses will be conducted in 2 partner universities or with a space company (as, for example, supported by CIFRE funding in France). The promotion of research results, in the partner company and the creation of start-ups or through patents will be favoured.

**3-year target**. Have initiated some joint supervised doctorates, involved doctoral students in the activities of the Alliance, and began to set up a joint program for doctoral studies.

**7-year vision**. Extensive joint research and doctoral interaction involving other funding mechanisms
