## Description of activities

## 4.1 Preamble
### Participants
LTU (lead), All
### Description
To meet the demands of the 21st century society and become a future ready Higher Education we need to explore more flexible and dynamic, innovative approaches to learning and teaching. This also entails reconsidering the traditional roles and players in education, and opening up to a wider range of stakeholders and communities, creating an education that is more interactive, personalised and engaging by new technological tools. The skills and competencies necessary for the future need to be part of Higher Education, which should be personalized, digitalized and international in its nature. WP4 is the explorative foundation that delivers methods, know-how and a base for pedagogical implementation to other WPs. WP4 further prepares knowledge capital among teachers, deliver pilot implementations, establishes digital platforms and curate resources.

## 4.2 Training program for teaching staff and educational developers/teaching advisors
### Participants
LTU (lead), All
### Description
This task will foster collaboration that shares existing knowledge and models, and utilize the different competencies of individuals and universities to develop innovative models and methods and support practical development through knowledge and resources. Through educational initiatives such as courses and educational materials online as well as joint development work, a higher and shared knowledge and capacity for innovative pedagogy is developed.

A smaller group of leaders, teachers and developers are gathered to define needs, conditions and inventory of existing resources and knowledge, and to allocate resources and define goals for local and joint development efforts.

One key activity of this task is to hold staff seminars with participants from the entire consortium. The objective of the seminars will be to exchange knowledge and best practices about teaching and learning methods and tools, especially didactics, in the field of Aerospace. The seminars will focus on the use of “Open Educational Resources”, upcoming technology like VR, AR, AI and advanced simulation technology. “Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching, learning and research materials in any medium – digital or otherwise – that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions.” (UNESCO definition). The final output of this seminar will be a joint presentation of possible resources and future practices in the teaching of Aerospace. The results from the seminars will be published on the project website to be accessible as a common platform of resources for all teachers.

The work is performed in three steps or levels as detailed below:
- Step 1 EXCHANGE/SHARE
	This step will administer access to each other's innovative examples of course content and processes. The outcome is a selection to pick and choose from, for example course assignments, exam questions etc. This “smörgåsbord” may be aleady existing parts of courses, which both in content and processes are shared with others.
- Step 2 COOPERATION
	This step will map joint needs and resources and based on those create mini packages in learning platforms - if possible easy to export into different Learning Management System. Each package is run on each university respectively with physical meetings and collaboration with the “home” teachers. Thus, a joint culture is created in the structure but the execution is performed and adjusted to each joining university.
- Step 3 COLLABORATION and TESTED
	This step will build further on the outcomes from steps 1 and 2, and push the culture change and innovation, to increase the sense of a joint community, not only among organisers and designers of the courses but also between the participating teachers.

**Year 1**: Develop common understanding and identify competence gap. Identify and make available existing concepts and examples. Explore innovative opportunities in the merge of upcoming technology and critical principles for good teaching.

**Year 2**: Cooperation and development of limited competence enhancement and teaching examples

**Year 3**: Implementing a collaborative culture and testbed for ideas and proof of concept

A long-term goal is to establish a community of practice concerning aerospace educational development. That involve both students, teachers, researchers and educational advisors/developers.

## 4.3 Personal Learning Network
### Participants
LTU (lead), All
### Description
This task addresses personal learning network (PLN) development for teachers as well as students A PLN is a learning environment often consisting social media communication, individuals, organisations and companies that a professional performer follows or interacts with to enhance their professional development. It is a global, online community that allows you to access knowledge and focus on what you consider most important to your learning. PLNs are especially valuable as new information and ideas are changing the world at a much faster pace than ever before. PLNs are informal and designed completely by individuals or groups, and allows personalized learning.

Within the framework of UNIVERSEH, an online seminar will be organized for professors from the Alliance on how to create a PLNs. The training will consist of different modules: the use of social media and open resources as professional tools, building a network for access, processing, design and communication of information and being active in the network. The training will focus on two objectives: professor being able to create PLNs and to teach the process to students. The second point is important as it will encourage an informal student-centred learning model that responds to the 21st century needs of educating students for lifelong learning. As you get to choose your topic of focus (technology skills, digital competencies...) a PLN is a way to strengthen the professional identity and strengthen the employability of students. Professors will guide students on how to develop their PLN through integration of the use of PLNs into their courses e.g, by raising awareness of students on how to develop their PLNs and on the need to devote time in an active manner to this way of learning to benefit from it.

**Year 1**: seminars and mini courses for staff

**Year 2**: pilot mini course for student including evaluation

**Year3:** implementing strategy for teacher competence development and educational incorporation of PLN in study programs

A long term goal is to integrate PLN as a basic competence and outcome for students and by that develop their ability to become a connected professional.

## 4.4 From Student to Teacher
### Participants
LTU (lead), All
### Description
This task addresses the concept of making students to be part of other students learning and at the same time develop their own knowledge of the subject and professional identity. The work encompasses several levels of activities where students contribute to teaching by creating material or performing as a resource for other students. The strength lies partly in strengthening the university's teaching capacity, but also in the dual learning function wherein students who teach develop deeper and broader knowledge and practice in an important professional knowledge, as well as increase their ability to communicate their knowledge and educate others.
The first step is to identify appropriate parts of education within the teacher group and discuss how and why students have an important role as a teacher or support for learning, both educationally and in terms of capacity.

The next step is to invite a group of students who, together with educational developers and subject experts, design different variants in which students participate in teaching or produce material for other students' learning.

The third step is to try with different student groups and courses how the different actors experience the situation with teachers, teaching students and learning students. A clear and natural group is, for example, doctoral students who need to train their pedagogical account of their knowledge and put it in context where others will develop related knowledge
The last step is to evaluate different models against what contribution it makes to the learning for the students who teach, for those who will learn and for the capacity and environment for teaching

**Year 1**: seminars and mini courses for staff, identify pilot arenas and student groups

**Year 2**: 3-5 limited projects including evaluation

**Year 3**: implementing “student as teachers” as regular education design in a study program, testing limited projects in different educational settings

A long term goal is to establish a learning environment where students is considered as natural resources in formal education activities

## 4.5 Hybrid learning and Virtual classroom
### Participants
LTU (lead), All
### Description
**Concept**: This task will build the technical foundation to achieve consortia-wide hybrid learning, digital twin classes and virtual classroom functionality, both of which set high requirements on technical, logistical, and digital solutions. All members of the Alliance are currently with high priority exploring these innovative approaches, and the task will bring our efforts together in this area. A hybrid approach to course delivery combines face-to-face classroom instruction with online activities. This reduces the amount of seat time compared to a traditional face-to-face course and moves more of the course delivery online. During classroom instruction time, students can be engaged in authentic, collaborative learning experiences. The online components can include multimedia-enhanced content and channels for ongoing discussion. The virtual classroom takes the concept one step further, and completely eliminates the physical meeting place. This aim is to be able to connect in synchronized sessions from anywhere in the consortium, in high quality and with an audio- visual production. This re-creates the face-to-face learning experience students can have in on-campus sessions.

**Implementation**: Online meetings will be organised with persons in charge of hybrid learning and virtualization in each university, with the goal to form a common understanding of the current state in terms of solutions that they are available for teaching and learning in hybrid and virtual settings. A catalogue of best practices and difficulties will be implemented and published on the project website. Following this initial phase, focus will be set on the online activities offered to make these accessible to the other partners. Thereafter, creation will commence of new common online activities. The long-term goal is to integrate the new online activities in the new courses and programs that are developed in WP3 of the project.

For the completely virtualized classroom, the students will need only to connect via their browser and a computer with a camera and speakers. They will join a comprehensive classroom experience with students participating in classroom and/or on-line simultaneously in which they can see and converse with the professor and their classmates. The target is to allow independency of geographical location, and give remote-based students an almost ‘being-here’ experience - some in classroom some not.

**Year 1**: Identify and evaluate technical/logistical/digital solutions and explore virtual classroom concepts

**Year 2**: Identify pedagogical enhancement opportunities need and evaluate technical/logistical/digital solutions

**Year 3**: evaluating Hybrid learning and virtual classroom in different educational settings and designing implementation strategies

## 4.6 Accreditation process: Learn abroad and validate at home
### Participants
LTU (lead), All
### Description
This task will investigate, and, when feasible, develop the regulatory and administrative framework required for a seamless accreditation of credits studied virtually or on another campus into the system of a student’s home university. As a mid-term goal we would like to allow students to follow an online course from another HEIs member of consortium and receive credits from the home university for attending the course. This permits inter-campus and inter-system mobility.

The onset of the work will be to identify and, when possible, remove administrative barriers. In order to facilitate this process, the work will bring together administrative staff from the whole consortium who have good insight in these regulatory matters. From this setting, we expect the identification of hinders as well as possible openings for solutions. These conclusions will thereafter be brought to the academic board for discussion on what are the current barriers, how to remove them, and for the formulation of a directional steering document. This steering document will thereafter be brought back to administrative specialist group to implement measures to reach the target of the task..

**Year 1**: Share best practice and identify staff resources for development

**Year 2**: Design and evaluation of different educational settings.

**Year 3**: Evaluation and design of implementation strategy and resources

Long term goal is to enhance the outcome of other WPs (2) in a more regular way.

## 4.7 Digital experiment-based learning
### Participants
ISAE SUPAERO (lead), All
### Description
This task aims to address the problem of a distance scientific experimentations for pedagogical purpose and proposes a digital platform that provides a set of digitalized real experiment to be integrated in digital learning contents.

Several works in cognitive psychology have demonstrated the added value of practical work in learning methods. In this context, digital technologies have promoted the emergence of new tools dedicated to pedagogy, and we address the support for online labs and scientific experiments. It is a vector for improving learning performance and understanding of the acquisition process. Then what about practical work in the context of digital? The general objective is to free practical experimentation from the constraints of face-to-face teaching and technical support, allowing to experiment remotely with a scalable approach to any learners. Existing solution are often based on model-based simulators that may leads to approximations and a breakdown in the scientific methodology aiming at validating a theory from real-world experiments results. Teleoperation of remote physical labs is also sometimes implemented, but this approach is hard to implement for a robust and qualitative service and do not scale (i.e., one learner can use the remote lab at the same time). Here, we propose an original approach based on real experiment digitalization that provides a scalable, accessible and economic way to deploy experiment-based learning to learners.

IREAL stands for “Interactive Remote Experimentation for Aerospace Learning”. IREAL is an ongoing effort leading to a platform that provides a set of pre-digitalized online experiments integrated into labs for learners. This platform allows the student to dive into the scientific experiment process, through a workflow with several steps: experiment setup, experiment launch and control with real time progress visualization through multimedia widgets and finally getting access to the experience measurements and results for analysis purpose. The online experiments are proposed through a standard web object that may be integrated in any learning platform. For example, it can be included into a campus Learning Management System or even onto an ADN (see following tasks) to propose a lab illustrating theoretical concepts. The experiments themselves are integrated into IREAL using an original approach based on digitalization of real scientific experiments. It integrates the complete presentation and digitization of the underlying data and distributes them to the students through an ad-hoc interface.
A very first version of the IREAL platform has been early designed and implemented to provide the necessary global structures and to proof the underlying concepts. The present project will beneficiate from these first developments, that will be enhanced with new features depending on targeted experiment needs. Several experiments dedicated to the target topic of this project will be implemented into IREAL, either locally in University of Toulouse and also with Universities partners that may need such a support. In conjunction with WP2 that will identify several experiments in the context of space engineering, we will implement methodology and support to help local or remote scientific teams to achieve their own experiment digitalization in such a way to provide the experiment datapack needed for IREAL. Then we will integrate the experiment into IREAL and provide proper way to access, set up and deploy for end usage by learners. These experiments will be made available for use in digital contents and particularly in ADN (Aerospace Digital Nuggets, see related task).

The task is scheduled as follows:

**Year 1**: Presentation over UNIVERSEH partners of IREAL concept, platform and possible usages. Design of a methodology to digitalize scientific experiment. Digitalization of a new scientific experiment. Identifying connected resources and experiences within the consortium.

**Year 2**: IREAL digitalization methodology deployment over UNIVERSEH partners. Existing IREAL platform evolutions and enhancements. Implementation of new experiments.

**Year 3**: Existing IREAL platform evolutions and enhancement. Integration of new experiment digitalized by UNIVERSEH partner. Usage analysis.

From a long-term point of view (i.e, 7 years), we would like to add more IREAL experiments. Another long term objective is to explore immersive learning and experiments involving cross reality (XR). This approach is particularly adapted to the space domain. The objective is here to facilitate the design and implementation of realistic experiments within the framework of a mastered pedagogical approach. We propose to setup a system allowing the learner to access intuitively a set of its physical and functional characteristics helping him to feel and understand the concepts with either virtual, augmented or mixed reality.

## 4.8 Microlearning platform
### Participants
SAE SUPAERO (lead), All
### Description
The micro-learning approach is now experiencing a growing interest in the higher education community. In this context, we propose the support of shorts reusable learning content by the way of "Aerospace Digital Nuggets" (ADN). These digital learning nuggets dedicated to aerospace are small chunk of interactive knowledge proposed digitally, build by design to be integrated into various pedagogical modality. They may be use in many ways : e.g., in a campus teaching in the context of a flipped classroom, to be integrated into a MOOC or a SPOC or even to participate in a longer assembly as part of an online program leading to certification, university credits, or even graduation. In this project, we want to focus particularly on the micro-learning usage and the digital environment requested.

The micro-learning service provides to the learner, a direct way to pick knowledge aligned with their needs. This approach may be used in the context of project or problem-based learning, for specific learning during innovation, or simply when a learner did not understand a part of a course. Any situation where the learner want to be free to access to the content he wants is eligible. This approach is particularly adopted to the younger generation of learners who are used to digital learning in general and mobile learning. In this context, we propose to set up the necessary architecture allowing to host nuggets and provide a micro-learning platform adapted to UNIVERSEH.

ISAE-SUPAERO has validated the technical concept of ADN, and particularly the dynamic reuse of micro-content in external learning platforms though digital learning standards. We implement a prototype carried out in 2019. The present project will beneficiate from UT/ISAE-SUPAERO expertise and aims at build a robust solution.

In this project, a microlearning platform will be setup to provide a way to present, find and serve efficiently the micro-contents developed during this project. The learners will be able to access to these ADN through simple internet connection and recent web browser.

The nuggets are small (less than 30mn learning time) chunk of interactive knowledge proposed digitally, that will be serve “as a service” on a cloud-based approach. This approach for deploying the content has many advantages: content development standardization, integration, maintenance, but also capacity to track the usage either in terms of access or even for learning analytics. The micro-learning platform will be implemented having these guidelines in mind:
- A way to produce ADN properly: the content will be developed in accordance with technical and functional specifications provided by the project.
- A way to submit ADN to publication in an “Nuggets repository”. A review can be implemented in order to optimize the compliance with the specifications and to optimize reusability.
- A way to qualify contents by integrating basic meta-data (e.g. title, author, learning time), but also learning objectives, and all the metadata needed to better manipulate, find and in a long-term perspective, compose a selection of ADNs.
- A way to store and efficiently serve the ADN to learning platform. A special attention will be put on scalability to achieve a high-performance service.
- A way to access to "Aerospace Digital Nuggets” (ADNs) through a microlearning online service accessible via Internet network through a modern web browser. The digital service will be based on (de facto) open standards facilitating exchanges and reducing the technical adherence of the platform to a specific provider.
- A way to collect learning analytics by the way of standard learning traces (xAPI) through a learning record store
- Advanced services: a set of value-added services exploiting both ADN-related metadata and learning traces resulting from the operational use of the device. A suggestion system may be envisaged, enabling the system to propose ADNs in relation to the learning that has taken place.

**Year 1**: Initial version of ADN author, initial version of ADN repository

**Year 2**: Initial version of microlearning platform and integration with other components

**Year 3**: Platform evolutions and learning analytics implementation From a long-term point of view (i.e, 7 years), the ambition is to enhance the platform with advanced services helping learner to find and compose ADN, to build their own learning path. Helped with technologies such as traffic analysis, learning analytics and artificial intelligence, our ambition will be to provide high performance tool to help students in their learnings. In parallel, the platform will be secured to provide a scalable, robust and industrial service able to serve ADN both to micro-learning platform but also to dynamically integrate the micro-contents dynamically into any standard Universities Learning Management Systems.

## 4.9 ADN Factory
### Participants
ISAE SUPAERO (lead), All
### Description
The "Aerospace Digital Nuggets" (ADNs) are pedagogically elaborated contents, integrating high quality interactive multimedia contributions. The content is deliberately limited, it covers one or a few micro-learning objectives, then inducing only a short learning time (e.g., less than 30 min). It requires to include interactions with the learner mainly for auto-evaluation purpose. No social (human) interaction is present into the nugget which can be deported to the user's platforms (e.g. Learning Management System or micro- learning platform). The object of the ADNs is to provide knowledge about a specific notion, used individually or as a basic component for a larger training program. In order to promote their reusability, these objects are constrained by precise specifications in terms of implementation technology and digital learning point of views.

In this project, the concept of ADN and the necessary production will be designed and developed, to allow a distributed implementation across several institutions.

The ADN notion have been early developed at ISAE-SUPAERO, the project will beneficiate from this expertise. The added value of this task is mainly to share the methodology and produce few ADN examples aligned with the project domain. An engineering production processes providing a framework for ADN development in higher education Universities will be issued. Several approaches for ADN production will be designed, considering the context and digital maturity level of experts in such a way to provide a robust and scalable approach to course digitalization. We will provide a guideline defining a production process, considering the ADN’s requirements in terms of technical and pedagogical requirements, but also to optimize the production process and make it easier to deploy. This production engineering will have to consider the technical constraints allowing an optimal exploitation, all pedagogical openness with a user-centered approach: particularly learners and teachers and practical constraints. In conjunction with WP2 that will identify several ADN in the context of space engineering, several ADN will be carried out for providing inspiring examples aligned with the thematic context of UNIVERSEH. They will be integrated into the digital platforms developed in related task.

**Year 1**: Presentation over UNIVERSEH partners of ADN concept and usage. Design of a methodology for production engineering to design properly ADN. Production of few local, space oriented ADN to evaluate and illustrate the methodology. Identifying relevant existing Open Educational Resources to inspire and strengthen the pedagogical and technical quality.

**Year 2**: Deployment of methodology for ADN production engineering over UNIVERSEH partners. Production of space oriented ADN.

**Year 3**: Support for ADN partner production. Production of space oriented ADN.

From a long-term point of view (e.g., 7 years), the ambition is to build the world largest micro-content repository dedicated to space domain.
