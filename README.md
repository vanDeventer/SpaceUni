UNIVERSEH

## Abstract
UNIVERSEH brings together 5 HEIs uniting over 130 977 students, 13 030 staff and 59 associates. With a particular focus on “Space” in all its aspects, the Alliance will work towards the following goals:
-To enhance mobility and multilingualism: we will enhance current support services and develop common ones such as the Feel at home program. A report on students mobility experience within the Alliance will be produced. Furthermore, the Alliance will develop mobility opportunities, create new partnerships and organize short term mobility. We will also promote and facilitate access to different language courses, diversify the offer and contribute to developing students’ tandems.
-To develop new joint Interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral curricula: we will involve different stakeholders; collect information on the current and future needs, then, based on our courses, we will create new interdisciplinary curricula.
-To develop new pedagogical models: we will explore new innovative opportunities: personal learning networks, hybrid and virtual learning and student to student learning
-To become an entrepreneurial “university”: the Alliance will develop new common entrepreneurship courses adapted to European space sector, develop different activities such as call for project with stakeholders, support to students’ projects, networking and mentoring program, student practical experience in research and innovation infrastructures. All the actions will be supported by a strong Business-University cooperation.
-To address some of the barriers students can face when it comes to joining higher education in general and studying abroad in particular: the Alliance will produce a EuroCharter on Equity, Inclusion and Diversity: towards European standards, testimonial videos of Women in the Space sector, a blog for students with specific needs to enable them to share experiences and staff seminar for common guidelines and improvement of services for mobile students.
